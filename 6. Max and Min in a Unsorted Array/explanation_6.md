Problem 6
In this problem, the goal is to get the min and max value from an input list in O(n) time, with the additional purpose of finding the min and max in a single traversal. To do this, the first value of the list is stored as the min and the max. Then the list is linearly traversed, and each number along the list is compared against the current min and max values, which are updated as needed. The min and max values are then returned. Regarding space complexity, the intermediate min and max values are stored to compare against during the traversal.
