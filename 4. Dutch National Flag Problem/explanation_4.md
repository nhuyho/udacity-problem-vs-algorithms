Problem 4
In this problem, the task is to sort a list of numbers that only contain 0, 1 or 2. The expected runtime is O(n). Since there are only 3 possibliities for values in this list, I created 3 lists to hold the zeros, ones and twos. Then I linearly traversed the original list and assigned the current element to its appropriate storage list based on its value. Once the list is traversed, the 3 storage lists are concatenated, which is also an O(n) operation. In terms of space complexity, there are the 3 lists holding the numbers while travering the original list. The size of those lists will depend on the original list length
