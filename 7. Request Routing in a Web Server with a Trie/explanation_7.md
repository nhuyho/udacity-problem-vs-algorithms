In this problem, the task is implementing an HTTP router using a Trie. The path segments reside in RouteTrieNodes within a RouteTrie object. The Router class wraps the RouteTrie object and handles the incoming path requests. The RouteTrieNode stores its path and a handler and stores its children RouteTrieNodes within a dictionary. The insert method adds children to that dictionary in O(1). The RouteTrie has a root node and root node handler, which are initialized when the Router class is initialized. The Router class has an add_handler function that takes in a path, has the approach split into a path array by the split_path process, and then calls the insert function in the RouteTrie class. The insert function in the RouteTrie class calls the insert function of the RouteTrieNode class. Since I'm looping over each element in the path array, this is O(n). The Router class also contains a lookup function, which takes in a path, has the approach split by the split_path process, and then calls the find function in the RouteTrie class. Since I'm also looping over each element of the path array here, this is also O(n). My code should work for the additional cases of a path not found and a path with a trailing "/." Regarding space complexity, the amount of storage used will depend on the number of nodes within RouteTrie.
