Problem 3
In this problem, the goal is to take in a set of numbers and produce the two numbers from that set of numbers that would have the most significant sum. The maximum sum results from creating two numbers that consist of alternating numbers from the original array starting from the highest to the lowest number. The initial input array would need to be sorted. Since the expected run time is O(n*log(n)), Merge Sort or Quick Sort would need to be used. I used Merge Sort to solve this problem, sorting in descending order. With the array sorted, I formed a left number array and a suitable number array by getting every other number from the sorted array. Then I build the numbers from the exhibition and return them. Regarding space complexity, there isn't much being stored except the halves of the collection during the merge process and the final sorted array.
